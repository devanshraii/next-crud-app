# Next.js CRUD App

A simple CRUD application built with **Next.js** and **MongoDB**. This app allows users to register, log in, update their details, and delete their accounts. It demonstrates the use of JWT authentication, MongoDB for storing user data, and RESTful API endpoints for user management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete users.
- **Secure API Endpoints**: API endpoints are protected using JWT authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js (v15.1.0)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
